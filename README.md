## Interactive Plotting

## OVERVIEW
An interactive plotting tool supporting .fil files from the Breakthrough Listen Open Data Archive. Interactive functions support increasing the signal the signal to noise ratio by downsampling and subbanning frequency channels, adjusting contrast of colormap, and flagging unwanted channels.


The Breakthrough Listen initiative aims to search for extrateterrestrial life by looking for alien technosignatures. These technosignatures are often masked by radio frequency interference (RFI) such as Wi-Fi, cellphone signals, or any unwanted signal. We suspect technosignatures to come in the form of a transient signal, in particular, Fast Radio Bursts (FRB). Part of this project is using machine learning tools to classify FRB signals. However candidates classified by the machine learning is not neccessarily a real signal. The main purpose of this GUI is to provide an efficient method for human users to search through these potential FRB candidates and confirm the candidates discovered by machine learning.
